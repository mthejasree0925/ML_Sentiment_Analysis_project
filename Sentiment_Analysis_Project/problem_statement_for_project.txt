Assignment:
Try with the possible classifiers: and select one algorithm which is giving the best accuracy and other metrics

one algorithm is selected:

u need to develop the production ready Code -- .py File  is called as production ready code

As part of production ready code:

1. Data Preprocessing function
2. Text to numerical data conversion function using bag of words or tfidf vectorizer(Need to save the vectorizer object in pickle file for test data conversion)
3. Model building function (need to save the model in pickle file for prediction)
4. Model prediction function( we will be using the saved model and saved vectorizer object in pickle file for predicting the new data)

once model training and model prediction  code is ready develop the basic front end with the help of flask or streamlit and integrate the code with our prediction function

once everything is ready, create a repository in ur git hub account for this Sentiment analysis project and push the code in that repository
